**Project Brief: Customer and Product Segmentation for E-commerce**

**Domain:** E-commerce

**Business Context:**
Customer segmentation is a powerful marketing strategy that helps businesses understand their target audience better. This involves grouping customers based on shared characteristics, which can include buying habits, age groups, lifestyle, personality traits, opinions, interests, reviews, and ratings. By segmenting customers effectively, brands can tailor their marketing campaigns and promotions to specific groups, making their efforts more efficient and relevant.

**Dataset Description:**
The dataset at hand comprises fit feedback and other related information from RentTheRunway, an innovative platform that offers clothing rental services for various occasions. The dataset includes customer self-reported fit feedback, reviews, ratings, product categories, catalog sizes, and customer measurements, among other data points.

**Project Objective:**
The primary goal of this project is to leverage customer and product data to segment similar users and items into meaningful clusters. By doing so, we aim to gain insights that can help the e-commerce organization enhance its marketing and promotional strategies. This analysis will involve:

1. **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on their profiles, including purchasing behavior, age, and other characteristics.

2. **Product Segmentation:** Classifying products into categories or clusters based on fit feedback, reviews, and other attributes.

3. **Insights Generation:** Analyzing the segmented clusters to uncover patterns, preferences, and trends among customers and products.

The ultimate objective is to assist the e-commerce company in delivering more targeted and effective marketing campaigns, ultimately boosting sales and customer satisfaction.

By applying data-driven segmentation techniques, this project will help the organization better understand its diverse customer base and product offerings, facilitating data-backed decision-making for growth and success in the competitive e-commerce landscape.
